### Time to fly

We are flying most weekends from around 9:00am until 3:00pm depending on the weather.

Flying may also be on during week day, depending on who is free. Some members
frequently fly after work. Our field is flyable until sunset.

### Rules

All flying at the NAAS facilities are bound by the rules in the [NAAS procedures](/assets/NAAS-Procedures.pdf) and by-laws.

NAAS is associated with the MAAA and, hence, all [MAAA procedures and
policies](https://www.maaa.asn.au/club-support/maaa-documents) are to be
followed. Likewise, all operation of model airplanes at our field is subject to the
[CASR Part 101
regulation](https://www.casa.gov.au/standard-page/casr-part-101-unmanned-aircraft-and-rocket-operations)
on unmanned aircraft and rockets.

The individual operator of a model aircraft is responsible for his/her
compliance, and his/her modelâ€™s compliance with the above regulations.

Flying at NAAS is **not** bound to a 400ft ceiling like at most other clubs.

### Spectators

Spectators from the general public are always welcome. 
We ask them to stay in the visitor area and see a club member for safety precautions.

### Flying Visitors

- Members of the general public: up to four flights under instruction from a NAAS member before
  becoming a member. 

- Other flying visitors must have current MAAA affiliation.
