### About the Area


*Naas Valley* is an area south of
[Canberra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra), 
[Australia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia) in the 
[Brindabella](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brindabella_Ranges)
Ranges which was first settled by Europeans in 1834. 
The watershed of *Naas Creek* forms the southern and south-eastern boundary of
the [Australian Capital
Territory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory), as
specified in the [Seat of Government Acceptance Act
1909](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seat_of_Government_Acceptance_Act_1909)
[[1]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naas). 

The first European settler of the Naas Valley was William Herbert who was a
[squatter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squatter). However, by 1848 Herbert
was granted 2428 hectares of land on a
[leasehold](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leasehold) basis [[2]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naas)

The area is now mostly part of [Namadgi National Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namadgi_National_Park).
