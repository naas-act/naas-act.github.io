title: "Work Experience at Merimbula Airport"
---

NAAS member Marius B successfully completed a work experience week with [Merimbula
Aircraft Maintenance](https://www.facebook.com/MerimbulaAircraftMaintenance/).
In a sense, this was a step up from the model airplanes Marius puts together
throughout the year. He was somewhat surprised to learn that, at times, these
full-size planes are much more fiddly than expected!

A big thanks to Rex, the owner, for hosting Marius so excellently and giving
him a gentle introduction into the wonderful world of work.

The following pictures give some impressions of what the week was like.
