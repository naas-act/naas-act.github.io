title: "Web Page Updates"
---
A couple of things:

- Photo galleries now open into fullscreen slide show when clicking on a photo, e.g. 
  [this one]({% link past-events/2018-NSWSAS-scala-comp/index.md %}).
- [Past events]({% link past-events/index.html %}) are now structured by event
  name.  
  More precisely, they are structured by the `title` tag in the header of the event page.
- [News]({% link news.html %}) are now simply presented on a single page (they are really not that long).
