The **National Aeromodelling and Aviators Society**, N.A.A.S.,
is a remote control model aircraft club and facility located in the beautiful
N.A.A.S. valley in the Namadgi National park in Canberra A.C.T Australia.

Our main goal has always been to ensure that our field facilities provide the
best opportunities for the enjoyment and safe flying of larger scale aircraft
and special interest groups. This is achieved through a strong community of
like minded, enthusiastic, skilled and energetic group of members. 
We nurture a variety of passions in the hobby, such as:

- Scale models: building (from scratch) and flying
- Aerobatics: IMAC and 3D
- Gliders and gliding
- ARFs and recreational ("sport") flying 
- FPV
- Organizing events
